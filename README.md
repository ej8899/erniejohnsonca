# dependencies
Using third-party libraries in web development has several advantages and disadvantages. The main pros of utilizing these libraries include faster development speed, improved code quality, and access to a wide range of pre-built functionalities. Third-party libraries enable developers to save time by leveraging existing solutions for common tasks, thereby reducing the need to reinvent the wheel. 

On the other hand, there are some cons to be considered when relying on third-party libraries. One major concern is the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities, as not all libraries may be regularly updated or maintained. Additionally, depending heavily on external dependencies can lead to increased application size and slower loading times, affecting user experience. 

As an "old school" developer, I often like to keep dependency use low and streamline built in methods instead of using libraries for "everything".

That being said, our portfolio site does use a few third party libraries:
- Jarallax
- Bootstrap
- Swiper
